## Features

- Real-time face detection in images and videos.
- High accuracy and speed using deep learning techniques.
- Easy to integrate with other applications.
- User-friendly interface for detection visualization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- OpenCV
- dlib
- numpy

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ishan004/Face-Detection-Model.git
    cd Face-Detection-Model
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install additional packages if not included in `requirements.txt`**

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install dlib
    pip install numpy
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the input data**

    - Place your input images in the `input_images/` directory.
    - Ensure your input videos are available in the `input_videos/` directory.

2. **Run the face detection script**

    ```bash
    python face_detection.py
    ```

3. **Output**

    - The detected faces in images will be saved in the `output_images/` directory.
    - Detected faces in videos will be processed and saved in the `output_videos/` directory.
